# Propofol Dreams EleMarsh ABW Calculator

Step by step guide to using the EleMarsh calculator:

(1) Enter patient details and desired Ce target

(2) EleMarsh generates 3 outputs: Adjusted Body Weight, Induction CpT and Adjustment Bolus

(3) Use the Adjusted Body Weight as the Marsh input weight on your TCI pump

(4) Use the Induction CpT as your initial CpT setting. As soon as the bolus is given, drop the CpT down to your desired CeT. The Marsh model on your pump will now mimic the behaviour of the Eleveld model.
